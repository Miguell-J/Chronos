## üöÄ What is Chronos?

**Chronos** is a custom-made, fully-featured Git-like version control system written entirely in Python.

It's designed to:

- üß† Teach you how Git works under the hood.
- ‚ö° Provide a transparent, customizable CLI for managing code.
- üß© Extend Git with new ideas like **environment snapshots**.
- üíª Serve as a foundation for new version control experiments.

Whether you're a hacker, student, researcher, or engineer ‚Äî Chronos is your programmable time machine.

## üß™ Snapshot System (comming soon)

Chronos introduces the concept of version-controlled **environment snapshots**, storing:

- Python packages (`pip freeze`)
- OS and platform info
- Shell environment variables
- Git metadata
- System tools (`uname`, `sys.version`)

```bash
chronos snapshot -m "Training env for GPT model"
````

Stored as `.chronos/.snapshot_env` and committed automatically.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

```bash
.git/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ objects/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <sha-1> compressed git-like objects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ refs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heads/       # Branches
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tags/        # Tags
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HEAD             # Symbolic or detached ref
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index            # Binary staging area
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config           # Repo metadata
```

All written and read in Python. No dependencies on Git internals.

---

## üß± How It Works

Chronos reimplements Git concepts from scratch:

* üß© `GitBlob`, `GitTree`, `GitCommit`, `GitTag` ‚Äî as classes.
* üß† Custom object (de)serialization, hashing (`SHA-1 + zlib`).
* üì¶ Fully binary index file (DIRC) parser and writer.
* üîç File metadata: uid, gid, perms, inode, size, etc.
* ‚öôÔ∏è HEAD management, ref resolution, detached states.

---

## üìå Example Usage

```bash
# Start a project
chronos init
chronos add main.py
chronos commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create and switch branches
chronos branch dev (comming soon)
chronos checkout dev

# Merge back into master
chronos checkout master
chronos merge dev (comming soon)

# Take an environment snapshot
chronos snapshot -m "AI experiment environment" (comming soon)
```

---

## üîÆ Roadmap

* [ ] `diff` support between working tree/index/HEAD
* [ ] Conflict resolution and manual merge tools
* [ ] `stash`, `rebase`, `revert`
* [ ] Chronos server: push/pull over HTTP
* [ ] TUI interface (like `lazygit`)
* [ ] Snapshots for datasets and models
* [ ] Visualization: commit graph renderer in SVG/HTML

## üß† Why Use Chronos?

| Feature             | Git     | Chronos        |
| ------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Language            | C       | Python         |
| Hackable            | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ              |
| Learnable Internals | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ step-by-step |
| Snapshots           | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ built-in     |
| Custom Commands     | Limited | Infinite       |
| Ideal for education | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ              |

Chronos was born to **educate**, **experiment**, and **push the boundaries** of version control.

## üß™ For Developers & Hackers

The source code is fully modular and readable. You can:

* Extend commands
* Add new object types
* Replace storage format (ex: graph-based file system)
* Build visual tools on top

Check out `chronos.py` ‚Äî every line is meant to be understood.
